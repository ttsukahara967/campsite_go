This is a sample API server for campsite information, built with Go and Gin.

## Features

- Simple RESTful API for campsites
- MySQL backend (runs in a Docker container)
- Hot reload development with [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
- Swagger UI (OpenAPI spec) available at [http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
